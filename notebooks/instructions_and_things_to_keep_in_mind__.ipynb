    "## **📖 THE STORY SO FAR:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chapter 1: The Perfect Pre-training**\n",
    "> \"PyramidNet-18 was successfully pre-trained on Fruit-360's studio photos, achieving 97.74% test accuracy. The model demonstrated strong capability to learn apple features in controlled conditions.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chapter 2: The Fine-tuning Failure**\n",
    "> \"However, when fine-tuned on real-world curated data, performance collapsed to just 55.36% validation accuracy. The model struggled to even fit the training data (50% training accuracy), suggesting a fundamental learning problem rather than overfitting.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chapter 3: Testing the Frozen Layers Hypothesis**\n",
    "> \"Initial hypothesis: 60% frozen layers constrained the model's ability to adapt. Experiment 1 unfroze all layers, yielding only 3.57 percentage points improvement (58.93%). This marginal gain revealed that frozen layers were not the primary bottleneck.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chapter 4: The Real Problem Emerges**\n",
    "> \"The persistent low training accuracy (~50%) across both configurations pointed to a critical issue: the learning rate (0.0001) was too conservative. The model was learning too slowly to converge within 50 epochs, as evidenced by the steadily decreasing but still-high loss values.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",

    "**Evidence:**\n",
    "1. Training accuracy stuck at 50-53% (should reach 90%+)\n",
    "2. Loss still decreasing at epoch 50 (hasn't converged)\n",
    "3. ReduceLROnPlateau reduced it further to 0.00005 (made it worse!)\n",
    "4. Model needs faster learning to converge\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis:** Increasing learning rate to 0.001 (10x) will allow model to converge and reach 70-85% accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Experiment 2 Plan:**\n",
    "- Keep: All layers unfrozen (Experiment 1 setup)\n",
    "- Change: Learning rate 0.0001 → 0.001 (10x increase)\n",
    "- Keep same: Max epochs 50\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project systematically explored transfer learning strategies for apple classification with limited data (800 images). Through three experimental phases, we discovered that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pre-training on mismatched domains hurts performance** (negative transfer)\n",
    "2. **Training from scratch with proper architecture matches pre-trained performance**\n",
    "3. **PyramidNet-18 is optimal for this dataset size** (11M parameters, 64.29% accuracy)\n",
    "4. **Optimization matters more than pre-training** for small datasets\n",
    "5. **64.29% is strong performance** given dataset constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "The complete experimental journey demonstrates the importance of:\n",
    "- Systematic hypothesis testing\n",
    "- Fair comparisons\n",
    "- Understanding when standard practices (transfer learning) don't apply\n",
    "- Architecture selection for dataset size\n",
    "\n",
    "This work provides practical insights for computer vision practitioners working with limited data and challenges the assumption that transfer learning always improves performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next step:** Build multimodal system using PyramidNet-18 to create practical apple identification and Q&A application.\n",
